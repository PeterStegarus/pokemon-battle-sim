battle:

while both pokemons still alive:
    make a command for each pokemon
    execute the 2 commands concurrently
        init turn:
            check if stunned or if able to dodge
            wait for both to pass init phase
        fight:
            apply the damage
        end turn:
            wait for both to reach end phase
            if an ability with stun was played, set stun now which applies for next turn
