A game plays 4 adventures of Trainer1's pokemons vs Trainer2's. Adventures are 1v1.

One adventure might have multiple arena fights of the pokemons vs wild Neutrels.
The adventure usually ends in the final arena fight, a 1v1 duel between the trainers' pokemons.
It could end sooner if one pokemon loses against the Neutrels.

After each arena fight, the undefeated pokemons evolve.g
